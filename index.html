                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>I am Nicolas Steinhauser, a 22 year old guy from Austria. I came to Canada over a year ago to play for the Rocket League Varsity Team and have been studying ever since. </p>
                <p>The things i enjoy most in life is gaming hanging out with friends and doing sports. I used to play soccer for 8 years until i got injured and had to forcefully quit the sport. After that i digged deeper into videogames and became really good at Rocket League which led me to end up here in Canada under a scholarship</p>
